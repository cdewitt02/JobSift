<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Created individually using Java Swing and MongoDB during Summer 2023 as a side project to my internship. It is deployed on a AWS cluster through MongoDB atlas
so anyone who can run the project has access to the database. I created the logo using a free AI tool online.

The idea is that the user/business can sift through all of the potential applicants (for businesses)
or jobs (for users) and decide which ones to take a close look at. To do so, one adds the item to their
"sift list" where there is more detail on the person or position.

I learned a lot doing this project including but not limited too
* The difficulties of encoding PDF files so they can be saved in JSON format (used Base64)
* Deploying a project to a cloud cluster
* Connecting MongoDB to a Java project
* Java Swing
* Password Encryption
* So much more

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
To run the project you'll need to have a JRE already downloaded onto your computer, then just open the JAR file located 
[here](https://github.com/cdewitt02/JobSift/tree/main/out/artifacts/JobSift_jar). It is written in Java 19 but it might be
compatible with other Javas. I tried to make the project a .exe file but the file was too big for GitHub to handle normally. 
Contact me if you want the .exe file.
